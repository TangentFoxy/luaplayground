--note
--original notes
object, call metamethod to function, string inside table for original string, name in table? save function? load function? history module?
notes object for storing data, append function or whatever, editor function, store all objects in _G sequentially so they can be exported and imported
 easily. names are also used to load canonical functions into _G
save the init table, load the string directly in, load the fn and prepare it in call...which means we can't save the init (at least not yet)
(mk fns print help text when called w no args) saving will go into a shitton of numeric files in working directory? dotfiles? subdir if available!!
load2 needs to be capable of accepting a name and setting it, so does note2, and add_tostring2 needs to create a metatable if needed
